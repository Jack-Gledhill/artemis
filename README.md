# Captain

Captain is my own personal take on a cross between GearBot and Rowboat. Of course, this bot is still in development and will be for a very long time.

**If you need support or wish to report a bug, please join my Discord server: https://discord.gg/pWraGYX**

## Features

You didn't come here to listen to me chatter about the unimportant stuff, you want the feature list, well here it is:
- Ban, unban, softban, kick, mute, unmute and warn commands
- Temporary muting, banning and lockdowns
- Purge in the current channel, a different channel, from a user or by bots
- Mod logging for actions, infractions, message edits/deletes and member joins/leaves
- Auto role
- Anti spam, ping-spam and invite
- Auto censoring
- Very high configurability
- Message archive to save sent messages
- Starboards
- Reaction roles
- Persistent roles
- Advanced control over who can use what commands

## Planned features

Here's what you can look forward to by clicking the Watch button in the top right hand corner:
- Roles for badges
- Reminders
- Configurable strike system to punish users after x warnings
- Anti links
- A web dashboard so that you don't have to restart to change a guild's config
- Custom commands
- Leveling

## Who can host this?

This isn't really the kind of thing your average Joe should be trying to run, especially if you have no clue about Python, Docker, Postgres or Redis. If you're one of those people but would really like an instance of Captain, join the Discord server below (or contact me) and I'll either give you my instance or help you set one up.

## Can I use the official instance?

Yup! Though only for public servers since my hosting resources are limited. If you want to use the official instance (which means new features sooner and hosting is done for you), then contact me on Discord at JackTEK#1942. It might be easier to find me by joining [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/uFgNnWx).

## Running your own instance
