# Artemis

Artemis is my own personal take on a cross between GearBot and Rowboat. Of course, this bot is still in development and will be for a very long time.

## Features

You didn't come here to listen to me chatter about the unimportant stuff, you want the feature list, well here it is:
- Ban, unban, softban, kick, mute, unmute and warn commands
- Temporary muting, banning and lockdowns
- Purge in the current channel, a different channel, from a user or by bots
- Mod logging for actions, infractions, message edits/deletes and member joins/leaves
- A few handy utils like a bot invite generator and source command
- Auto role
- Anti spam and invite
- Very high configurability
- Message archive to save sent messages

## Planned features

Here's what you can look forward to by clicking the Watch button in the top right hand corner:
- Reminders
- Configurable strike system to punish users after x warnings
- Anti links and swearing
- Starboards
- A web dashboard so that you don't have to restart to change a guild's config
- Custom commands
- Leveling
- Reaction roles

## Who can host this?

This isn't really the kind of thing your average Joe should be trying to run, especially if you have no clue about Python, Docker, Postgres or Redis. If you're one of those people but would really like an instance of Artemis, join the Discord server below (or contact me) and I'll either give you my instance or help you set one up.

## Can I use the official instance?

Yup! Though only for public servers since my hosting resources are limited. If you want to use the official instance (which means new features sooner and hosting is done for you), then contact me on Discord at JackTEK#1942. It might be easier to find me by joining [my Discord server](https://invite.gg/mila).

## Self-hosting Agreement

Another one of these? Wasn't Rowboat enough? I know, I know, but here me out, I'll try to be as lax as I can.
- You MAY NOT use the official instance's logo and name **at the same time** in *derivative* bots (forks or slightly modified instances)
- You MAY NOT host a public instance (so putting it onto bot list websites etc)
- You MAY NOT charge for usage of your instance
- You MAY allow a handful of servers (max of 15 please) to use your instance of Artemis

Of course, I can't force you to obey these rules, but not obeying them would be mean :(

## Running your own instance

For help with installing Artemis on your server, see my [official setup guide](https://docs.jacktek.net/artemis/getting-started).
