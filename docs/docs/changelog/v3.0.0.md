#### This was a major release that focused on rewriting the entire bot and improving the existing features.

## Features

* Added the ability to specify a message that will be DMed to a user whenever a certain action occurs (ban, mute etc.)
* Added statistic counters to show a server's statistics in voice channel names
* Added starboard functionality
* Added persistent roles to retain certain roles when a user re-joins the server
* Added reaction roles to let users choose from a handful of vanity roles
* Added lockdown functionality

## Improvements

* Message archives are now in the form of .html files, this removes the room for API failure and also avoids complications with the Discord ToS
* All of the code has been cleaned up on the backend to improve overall performance and make development easier
* Switched an easier-to-use emoji system that only requires a unicode emoji or a custom emoji string
* Renamed the bot to Captain rather than Artemis

## Removals

* Softbans have been removed and may return in the future
* Dropped the Archive API since it fails to properly comply with Discord ToS
* Informational commands have been dropped since they didn't fit in well with the bot, may return in the future
* The eval command was ditched since it was quite a bit of work to maintain and doesn't fit in with the bot
* Ditched the invite generator since it's more of a utility command 

## Bugfixes

* There were a variety of bugfixes with this release
