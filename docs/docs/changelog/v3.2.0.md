#### This was a minor release that focused on the addition of a handful of new features as well as some bug fixes and general improvements.

## Features

* Mod commands to set/change and remove a user's nickname
* Custom commands with the ability to specify whether to send a message or toggle a role
* An option to specify the bot's nickname in the guild's config
* Anti-link to prevent users from sending links in chat
* Roles for Badges to give roles to users depending on what profile badges they have
* Owner-only `control shutdown` command to gracefully shut down.
* A bot filter that allows you to block bots that aren't a certain age or don't have the verified checkmark
* A Gatekeeper system to require certain users (or all users) to verify themselves before gaining access to the rest of the server
	
## Improvements

* Renamed `reload guilds` to `control reload guilds`
* Owner-only commands will now be shown in the help command

## Bugfixes

* Fixed a bug with timed/temporary commands where the duration could be 0 seconds
* Fixed a pretty silly bug that prevented auto-role synchronisation from working
* Fixed a bug that prevented the check that required the `send_messages` permission from working
