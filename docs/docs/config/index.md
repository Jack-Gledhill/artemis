In this guide, I'll run through all of Captain's configuration options and how to use them.[^1]

To change a guild's configuration, you'll first want to make sure you have the **Manage Server** permission (you'll already have this if you're an admin or own the server) then head over to the web dashboard that came packaged with Captain!

!!! danger
	Captain's configuration uses something called yaml, if you do not know how to use this **do not attempt to configure Captain, you will probably break it**. If you need help, feel free to ask in the [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/EBFhZYY)!
