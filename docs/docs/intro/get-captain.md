There are two ways to get your hands on Captain:

1. You run your own instance;
2. Someone lets you use their instance

There are pros and cons to each method and I'll run through most of them here.

## Running your own instance

Pros:

* You have complete control over it, so you can start/stop and change any files whenever you like;
* You can upload it to your own machine meaning that you don't have to rely on the uptime of someone else's machine

Cons:

* You have to have your own machine that you can host the bot on;
* You have to set Captain up yourself, which means you need to understand how to read technical documentation and use Linux servers.

## Using someone else's instance

Pros:

* You don't have to set it up yourself;
* There's pretty much no investment needed

Cons:

* You have to rely on someone's upkeep of the bot;
* You can't change your guild's configuration when you want (this may change in the future);
* You have to actually find someone who will let you use their instance

## Summary

All in all, if you have the technical skill required, it is better to run your own. However, if you don't have the skill and really need the bot, you can contact me in the [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/pWraGYX) and I will arrange for you to use the official instance.
