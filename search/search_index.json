Certain sub-settings aren't shown because they're self-explanatory. \u21a9","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"config/access-control/","text":"In short, the access_control section allows server admins to configure which roles are allowed to use what commands. Example access_control : 123456789098765432 : # role ID level : 100 # 100 = admin (all commands) 123456789098765432 : # role ID level : 90 # 90 = mod (all commands except lockdown) 123456789098765432 : # role ID level : 90 # the same level can exist more than once overwrites : # by denying access to certain commands, this effectively becomes a \"trial mod\" role unban : false # each overwrite is in the format [command name: true/false] ban : false 123456789098765432 : # role ID level : 10 # 10 = trusted (all non-mod commands + some easter eggs) everyone : # everyone = every single member. This could also be a role ID for members, if you want level : 0 # 0 = default (non-mod commands) Levels and what they mean \u00b6 A level is sort of like a preset of commands that a role should use. For example, users with the mod level should be able to use Moderation commands, but not Administration commands (such as lockdown and infraction clearing). Below, you'll find a table showing which level ID matches a particular role. Role Level Administrator 100 Moderator 90 Trusted 10 Default 0 Creating your own levels \u00b6 Currently, there's no way to create your own level designation (e.g. 80 for trial mod), but it is planned. However, you can achieve the same effect by using an existing level as a base then adding overwrites. For example, here's what a trial mod level would look like (trial mods may have different access to commands for your server but the idea is the same). access_control : 123456789098765432 : # role ID level : 90 # we'll use moderator as a base here overwrites : ban : false unban : false inf search : false inf recent : false Breaking it down \u00b6 Alright so this look a little scary at first, but I promise it isn't! To summarise, the example above essentially means: trial mods can use all mod commands apart from ban, unban, inf search and inf recent . If you're still struggling, the good guys and gals in the official Discord server can give you a hand! Hierarchy \u00b6 The hierarchy for overlapping levels can be incredibly confusing, but I'll try to summarise it anyway. In short, the user's access to commands is first affected by their highest level. If their highest level doesn't affect a certain command, it will be affected by their second highest level (and this repeats). If the user has the same level twice that both overwrite the command (assuming the overwrites are different), then the order of the levels in the configuration file determines which takes priority. Summary TLDR; if you have a complex system of overlapping levels, it is best to just remove any unnecessary roles from the user that could cause conflicts.","title":"Access Control"},{"location":"config/access-control/#levels-and-what-they-mean","text":"A level is sort of like a preset of commands that a role should use.

Anti spam \u00b6 This is simple. If a user sends X messages within Y seconds, do Z action.

Often times, these words will be curses and derogatory terms. Example anti_curse : enabled : true action : 2 duration : 3600 ignored_roles : - 123456789098765432 # role ID ignored_channels : - 123456789098765432 # text channel ID blacklist : - nigga - faggot Anti invite \u00b6 Does what it says on the tin; stops users from sending invite links to other Discord servers. Example anti_invite : enabled : true action : 2 duration : 3600 ignored_roles : - 123456789098765432 # role ID ignored_channels : - 123456789098765432 # text channel ID whitelist : - discord-developers - discord-testers - discord-events Note Invites for the server will be ignored by Captain. Action \u00b6 This is a numerical value ranging from 1-4 that determines which action should be taken when a user triggers auto-mod. Refer to the table below to see which number matches which action. Action Key Ban 1 Mute 2 Warn 3 Nothing 4 Note No matter what the provided action number is, the message(s) that triggered auto-mod will be deleted. Duration \u00b6 If the action is set to 1/2 (ban/mute), the duration tells Captain how long the punishment should last. I.e. if the action is ban and the duration is 3600, any users that trigger auto-mod will be banned for an hour. Count \u00b6 This option is specific to anti spam and anti ping spam. This is the number of occurances that Captain will tolerate before invoking an action on the user. For example, setting this to 5 for anti spam means that a user needs to send 5 messages within the configured time period to trigger anti spam. Threshold \u00b6 This option is specific to anti spam and anti ping spam. This is the time period that a user has to trigger anti spam or anti ping spam. Usually, this should be pretty short for anti spam and pretty long for anti ping spam. Still don't understand? OK then. If the count and threshold for anti spam are both 5, that means a user has to send 5 messages within 5 seconds to trigger anti spam. Ignored roles & Ignored channels \u00b6 Hopefully self-explanatory. If a user has ANY of the ignored roles, they are exempt from that specific auto-mod feature. If the message was sent in one of the ignored channels, auto-mod ignores it. You get the drift? Good. Blacklist \u00b6 This option is specific to anti curse. This should be a list of words that are blocked by Captain. This will likely be populated by a list of derogatory terms and perhaps curse words (if you choose to block them in your server). Whitelist \u00b6 This option is specific to anti invite. This is a list of Discord invites that Captain will not filter.

First you need to build the image, then you need to run an instance of that image. It's easy though so don't worry! To build an image, cd into captain/bot then run docker build . docker build . --tag captain:3.1.0 Now all that's left to do is run an instance of the container with docker run . docker run -d --name captain --network=\"host\" captain:3.1.0","title":"Deploying a Captain container"},{"location":"setup/installation/#additional-support","text":"Congratulations, you have officially set up your own Captain bot! If, somehow, you haven't, then join the official Discord server and we'll be happy to lend a hand!","title":"Additional support"},{"location":"setup/prerequisites/","text":"A host \u00b6 The first, and most important, thing you'll need is a host. This can be a dedicated server (this could be an enterprise-grade server or just an old computer) or a virtual server (AKA VPS). Either way, the important thing you'll need is 24/7 uptime (or close to it). There are many providers out there that you can rent VPSs or dedicated servers from. Personally, I rent a 4 core, 8 GB RAM VPS from Contabo at \u00a34.50/m (about $5.90/m or 5 euros/m). Important note: the host you use MUST be running a Linux distribution! This guide assumes you're using a Ubuntu host, but any Linux host will have similar setup instructions. Git \u00b6 Git is an important CLI tool that's usually already installed on most Linux distributions. If it isn't, run the command below. sudo apt-get install git PostgreSQL \u00b6 You'll also need a PostgreSQL server. In layman's terms, this is a database. I recommend using this guide if you're using an Ubuntu server. If you're not using Ubuntu, I'm sure a quick Google search for your specific distro should do it. Docker \u00b6 Docker is a piece of software we use to place other software into what we call a \"container\". In simple terms, a container is an isolated environment that gives users superior control over the software they're running. I use this guide to get Docker up and running properly. Redis \u00b6 The final prerequisite is Redis. Redis is an in-memory database (in other words a cache) that Captain uses to temporarily store information for spam detection. You'll find that this guide will prove useful. As long as you run your Redis server on the same host as Captain, there isn't much need to setup a password since the information only lasts for a few seconds and doesn't reveal anything secret. Besides, only software on your host could access Redis in the first place.","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"setup/prerequisites/#a-host","text":"The first, and most important, thing you'll need is a host.
